A toolset for any kind of project based on Django: blogs, forums, shops or any
other. Its tools are designed to work together and to be compatible with the
last versions of Django.

Some of Yepes' tools are mature and well-tested, while others are just sketches
or trials. The documentation will only cover the first ones.
