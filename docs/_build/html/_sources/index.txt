Yepes documentation
====================

A toolset for Django projects
=============================

Yepes is a toolset for any kind of project based on Django: blogs, forums,
shops or any other. Some of its tools are mature and well-tested, while others
are just sketches or trials. This documentation will only cover the first ones.

The target of Yepes is to have a set of tools which are compatible with the
last versions of Django: from the last LTS (long-term support) release to
the next LTS release. For example, Yepes 1.0 (currently in development) is
compatible with Django 1.8 to 1.11 and the future Yepes 2.0 will be compatible
with Django 1.11 to 2.2.

Tests are required to ensure that all tools are compatible with target versions
of Django. Even tools which haven't received attention for some time, will
continue to work.

Tools included
==============

Yepes includes many tools for development of Web projects. Some tools extend
the functionality of tools provided by Django, while others are completely new.
