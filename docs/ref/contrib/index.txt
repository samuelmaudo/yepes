``contrib`` packages
====================

Some Yepes's tools need to include models, template tags, or views. Those tools
live in ``yepes/contrib`` and this document gives a rundown of them.

.. admonition:: Note

   For most of these add-ons you'll need to add the package name (e.g.,
   ``'yepes.contrib.datamigrations'``) to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and
   re-run ``manage.py migrate``.
